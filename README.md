# LearnSense

LearnSense is a prototype learning assistant designed to identify **invisible confusion** in learners before it becomes frustration or disengagement.

Instead of waiting for students to ask questions they cannot yet articulate, LearnSense analyzes what a learner *believes* they understand and surfaces likely conceptual gaps, misconceptions, and missing prerequisites.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Standardized instructional delivery assumes all learners process abstract concepts in the same way.  
In reality, students often get stuck due to **hidden misunderstandings** they cannot clearly express — causing learning to stall silently.

---

## 💡 Solution

LearnSense provides:
- Early detection of conceptual gaps
- Alternative explanations for abstract topics
- Clear next-step guidance for continued learning

By making confusion visible, LearnSense enables timely and targeted intervention.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The learner enters:
   - A topic they are studying
   - What they believe they currently understand
2. LearnSense analyzes the input
3. The system returns:
   - Likely misconceptions
   - Missing prerequisite concepts
   - A simplified explanation
   - Suggested next learning steps

## 🚀 Use Case

- Students learning abstract technical subjects
- Self-learners stuck without knowing why
- Educators seeking early signals of learning breakdown
